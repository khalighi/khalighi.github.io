## Introduction  
The way we store, move, and consume data today was never designed for physical AI. Robotics, autonomous vehicles, and embodied systems generate staggering volumes of multimodal data: streams of video from multiple cameras, LiDAR sweeps, radar returns, audio, IMU traces, and high-frequency control logs. Current datalakes treat these as raw signals to be written, stored, and retrieved. While this ensures fidelity, it creates bottlenecks. Storage footprints balloon, bandwidth costs skyrocket, and downstream consumption is rigid and inefficient.  

Human memory offers a different perspective. We do not store every pixel from each eye or every vibration in the ear. Instead, we remember **events**—compressed, multimodal, semantically meaningful experiences. These memories are efficient, reconstructive, and adaptable: we can recall details when needed, infer missing context, and retell the same experience differently depending on the audience.  

This analogy suggests a new direction for robotics data infrastructure: designing data systems that **store and transmit meaning rather than raw sensory traces**.  

## From Raw Signals to Representations  
Machine learning provides the building blocks for such systems. Embeddings, autoencoders, and multimodal encoders learn **latent representations** of data. These representations are not just compressed versions of the original signals, but structures that capture the *essence* of what matters.  

- **Compact**: An hour of multi-camera video may require terabytes in raw form but can be reduced to gigabytes—or even megabytes—of embeddings. This is not lossy compression in the traditional sense, but an abstraction that preserves task-relevant information.  
- **Semantic**: Latent spaces organize data around meaning. A “pedestrian crossing” event is closer to a “jaywalker” than to “parked car,” even if the raw pixels differ widely.  
- **Reconstructive**: Autoencoders and generative decoders can recreate an approximation of the original signal. This reconstruction may not match pixel-for-pixel, but it is “good enough” for visualization, debugging, or human interpretation.  
- **Multimodal**: Unlike traditional compression, embeddings can fuse inputs across modalities. A single event embedding can represent what multiple cameras, a LiDAR unit, and an IMU sensed at the same moment.  

If these embeddings became the **first-class unit of storage and transmission**, robots could write representations into the datalake rather than raw bytes. Downstream systems could then:  

- **Operate directly in latent space** for clustering, similarity search, anomaly detection, or training ML models.  
- **Reconstruct approximations** for visualization, replay, or debugging, trading fidelity for compactness when appropriate.  
- **Summarize data semantically**, allowing queries like “find all cases of cyclists weaving between cars” rather than trawling through petabytes of logs.  

## Blurring Storage, Transfer, and Compute  
Embedding-first design collapses the rigid layers of conventional infrastructure.  

- **At the edge (compute → storage)**: Robots and sensors encode data into embeddings as soon as it is generated. This minimizes the local footprint and prepares the data for efficient transfer. Edge devices take on more computation, but in return, the system avoids overwhelming storage with redundant signals.  
- **Across the network (storage ↔ transfer)**: Instead of transmitting raw images or LiDAR sweeps, robots transmit embeddings. This reduces bandwidth consumption by orders of magnitude. Just as humans exchange meaning through language instead of raw sensory streams, robots can exchange compressed representations that still capture essential context.  
- **At the consumer (transfer → compute)**: Embeddings are interpreted downstream. Sometimes this means decoding into a visualization for human inspection. Other times, it means feeding embeddings directly into analytics or training pipelines. The receiver chooses whether to “reinflate” the data or to operate on the compressed substrate.  

The traditional chain of *store → move → compute* is replaced by a **shared representational substrate**. Computation becomes naturally distributed: encoding happens at the producer, while decoding or inference happens at the consumer.  

This model is especially powerful for fleets of robots. Edge devices only upload embeddings, reducing network strain, while cloud servers aggregate and analyze them efficiently at scale.  

## Personalization and Customization  
Latent representations are not tied to one canonical form. They allow **audience-specific reconstruction and adaptive consumption**.  

Consider a cultural festival recorded by multiple robots or drones:  

- A **two-year-old child in Germany** might see a playful, simplified version with bright colors and reduced complexity.  
- An **elderly couple in China** could receive a contextualized narrative emphasizing cultural history and traditions.  
- A **robotics engineer** debugging perception models might see bounding boxes, trajectories, and semantic labels instead of a raw video.  

All of these experiences can come from the **same latent representation**. This flexibility reduces duplication and manual preprocessing.  

For physical AI, personalization matters because different stakeholders need different slices of the data:  
- Developers want detailed signals to debug.  
- Regulators want interpretable summaries for compliance.  
- End-users may want simplified, human-friendly visualizations.  
- ML pipelines require embeddings that can be directly consumed for training.  

Embedding-based systems enable all of this **without re-encoding or storing multiple copies of the same raw data**.  

## Multimodal Coherence  
Today’s datalakes treat sensor outputs as independent channels: left and right cameras, LiDAR sweeps, IMU readings, CAN logs. But robots, like humans, experience the world as **integrated events**.  

Latent representations naturally fuse these modalities into unified “event memories.” Instead of fragmented files scattered across formats, the system stores a compact, multimodal trace of *what happened*.  

This event-level representation simplifies downstream tasks:  
- **Retrieval** can be semantic (“find all near-miss events involving cyclists in the rain”) rather than modal (“search camera logs for frames with bounding boxes of cyclists”).  
- **Visualization** can be holistic, replaying an event across modalities without stitching together disparate files.  
- **Summarization** becomes possible at the level of experience, not modality—mirroring how humans remember.  

This coherence is essential for robotics, where perception, planning, and control depend on aligning multiple sensor modalities into a shared understanding of the environment.  

## Implications for Datalakes in Physical AI  
Embedding-centric design does not replace datalakes—it **redefines them**. The next generation of robotics datalakes will need to support:  

- **Streaming** latent representations from fleets in real time, reducing network strain and making it possible to monitor systems continuously without overwhelming links.  
- **Storing** embeddings as the canonical record, while keeping raw data selectively for audits, regulation, or rare reprocessing tasks.  
- **Visualizing** reconstructions in ways that are tailored to specific stakeholders—developers, operators, regulators, or even end-users.  
- **Summarizing** massive datasets semantically, enabling higher-level queries like “all incidents involving braking on wet roads” instead of raw sensor queries.  

In this vision, the datalake becomes more than a passive repository. It transforms into a **memory system for embodied intelligence**—compact, contextual, multimodal, and adaptive.  

## Challenges and Open Questions  
The transition to embedding-centric infrastructure is ambitious. Several challenges remain:  

- **Fidelity vs abstraction**: How do we ensure critical details are not lost? A robot’s compressed memory might suffice for training, but not for a regulator investigating an accident.  
- **Model evolution**: Embeddings depend on encoders and decoders, which will improve over time. How can stored embeddings remain useful across model generations? Should we re-encode past data as models improve?  
- **Interoperability**: Raw formats (JPEG, Parquet, ROS bags) are standardized. Latent formats are not. Without common standards, embedding-based datalakes risk fragmentation.  
- **Verification and trust**: Reconstructed data is approximate. Can regulators and safety engineers accept these approximations for compliance, accountability, or forensics?  
- **Efficiency at the edge**: Encoding requires computation, and many robots operate under resource constraints. Efficient, low-power embedding models are essential.  

Hybrid strategies—where raw and latent data are stored together—may provide a transition path, especially in safety-critical applications.  

## Outlook  
The explosion of multimodal data in robotics and physical AI makes current approaches—storing and transmitting raw signals—unsustainable. Embedding-centric systems represent a new paradigm: **storage, transfer, and compute collapse into a single representational substrate**.  

This unlocks:  
- **Scalability**: fleet-scale storage and transfer efficiencies.  
- **Semantic recall**: the ability to query by meaning, not byte offsets.  
- **Adaptive consumption**: reconstructions tailored to different audiences and use cases.  
- **Multimodal coherence**: storage and recall organized around events, not individual sensors.  
- **Distributed inference**: natural division of labor between producer (encoding) and consumer (decoding, analysis).  

For physical AI, this is not optional. It is the defining piece of data infrastructure that will allow robotics to scale in the real world. The next-generation datalake will not look like a vault of raw signals. It will look like a memory system—compact, contextual, multimodal, and reconstructive.
